      <h2>Tokyo</h2>
      <p>High rise, fast-paced and neon-lit, Tokyo is as futuristic as it is historical</p>
      <p>
        As Japan’s capital and the world’s most populous metropolis, Tokyo offers tradition and innovation, and unlimited opportunities to eat, shop and explore
        Tokyo is located on Tokyo Bay in the Kanto region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. The closest airport airports are Haneda officially known as Tokyo International Airport, and Narita Airport, Japan's largest international airport. Tokyo is known for its fashion and shopping, from the trendy shopping districts of Harajuku and Shibuya, to the luxury flagships of Ginza.
        Shinjuku is the thriving business district; a mix of gleaming skyscrapers and atmospheric back streets with tiny bars. Asakusa is the heart of Tokyo’s downtown, with ancient temples and traditional stores. Tokyo is a foodie paradise with more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city in the world, along with hundreds of cheap and delicious ramen shops.
        Tokyo Weather.
        Tokyo has mild spring weather, followed by hot and humid summers punctuated with typhoons. Autumn in Tokyo is cool and fresh, followed by cold, dry winters. Snow is rare but has been known to fall in the first few months of the year. The one week forecast for Tokyo is an accurate guide to the weather for the coming week.
        How to Get There
        Tokyo is served by two international airports, Haneda and Narita. From there, you can reach central Tokyo by regular or limousine buses, or have the option of the monorail (Haneda only) or trains. The Narita Express (N'EX) and Keisei Skyliner are JR and privately-run trains that connect Tokyo and Narita International Airport.
